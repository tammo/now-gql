# GraphQL + Zeit Now

The type definition and example is coming from <https://launchpad.graphql.com/1jzxrj179>.

Deploy via `now` (see <https://zeit.co>).

Run locally via `yarn dev`.

# why?

I wanted to find out how to "run" a GraphQL request on Zeit's infrastructure (now). And how to "resolve" a GraphQL request inside one function call.

This example just shows how to do it and is by no means a fully functional endpoint. It does not even parse the request body.
